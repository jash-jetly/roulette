# 🎰 **Roulette Game Simulator** 🃏

Welcome to the **Roulette Game Simulator**, where your Python scripts get to gamble responsibly (unlike humans)! This project lets you simulate a roulette game with the famous (and risky) **Martingale betting strategy**. Perfect for experimenting with probability, coding skills, and a sprinkle of humor.

## 🚀 **Features**
- 🎡 **Fully functional roulette wheel**: Spin and test your luck (or your bot’s).
- 📈 **Martingale Strategy Automation**: Witness the highs and inevitable lows of doubling down.
- 🖥️ **Simple Command-Line Interface**: Lightweight, no fluff.
- 🔥 **Adjustable Parameters**: Customize starting bets, bankroll, and number of spins.
- 💡 **Educational Purpose Only**: Because real gambling is a terrible idea.

## 🛠️ **How to Set Up**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/roulette.git
   cd roulette
   python3 game_with_bot.py

## 🎮 **How to Play**
1. **Start the Script:**
    Launch the game in your terminal using the command:
    ```bash
    python game_with_bot.py
    
**Set Parameters:**
1. Enter your starting balance (e.g., 1000).
2. Set your base bet (e.g., 10).


**Watch the Simulation:**
1. The bot will use the Martingale strategy.
  Double the bet after every loss.
  Return to the base bet after a win.
  See if the strategy works... or if your bankroll crashes.

## 🤔 **What is the Martingale Strategy?**
The Martingale betting strategy is a system where you double your bet after every loss, ensuring that a single win recovers all previous losses. However, it assumes:

1. Unlimited bankroll (spoiler: most don’t have that).
2. No betting limits (another spoiler: casinos do).
3. This script shows how dangerous this strategy can be when faced with real-world constraints!

## 🔧 **Customization**
You can tweak the following parameters directly in the script:

1. Starting Balance: The initial amount of money.
2. Base Bet: The minimum bet amount.
